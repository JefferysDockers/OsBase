# OsBase
Versions of Base OS Dockers

Copies of base OS distributions with specific fixed versions as much as possible. To use floating version, use the official repositories as there is no plan to keep this current with every distribution.

It is an open question if fixing the version works well enough without fixing the date of update for every package too, and then you lock in any problems or security issues that were not yet fixed. Version management of large heterogeneous things is not a simple problem.
